  answer:
    type: string
    default: Boiling water means heating it until it reaches a temperature where it
      changes from a liquid to a gas, specifically at 100°C (212°F) at sea
      level. This process is characterized by the formation of bubbles that rise
      to the surface and burst.  Boiling is often used for cooking, sterilizing,
      and making beverages like tea or coffee. It’s a simple yet essential
      process in many daily activities.
